# piano-practice

React app that lets you learn and practice playing chords using a MIDI keyboard. Works in any browser that supports the Web MIDI API (tested with Chrome and Edge).<br>

# Exercise Types

## Randomized

Prompts you to play a random chord in a random key. Inversions can also be enabled, allowing each prompt to ask you to play the chord in a specific inversion.

You can select what types of chords you want to practice (major, seventh, augmented, etc.) as well as what inversions.

## Chord Progression
Prompts you to play a chord progression in a random key. You specify what chord progression you want to practice in the exercise settings.
